- Placing the statement "debugger;" anywhere in the code will cause the code execution to stop, exactly on the line where the debugger statement was placed

- We can then inspect any of the variables that we encountered before that line

- After placing that debugger line we can run the following command: "node inspect <filename>.js"

- The file will be executed line by line, so typing in the command "cont" or "c", will allow us to move on to the next line of code

- To actually inspect any particular variable, we have to enter "REPL" mode, so we type the command "repl" into the debugger mode, and we can then
type in the name of the particular variable we are looking for

- We can also type in entire statements to see what value we are returned

- Ctrl + C to exit out of REPL and go back to debugger mode, another CTRL+C will exit out of the debugger mode

- NOTE: In order for the debugger to work, we need a manual function call present in our file, otherwise the debugger will not work
